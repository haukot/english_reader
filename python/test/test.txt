The Bell Of Minden’s Hall



I awoke with a hangover to the unpleasant and unwelcome sound of the village bell.

You’d expect a bell to tinkle merrily. There was no merriment in this toll – this bell was a locally produced, crudely forged iron affair that lived in a rickety rough stone belltower in the middle of the tiny mountain hamlet that was my home. It had a forlorn, off-pitch ring that you could hear for miles throughout the vales. This close, with this much of a hangover, it sounded like a particularly sadistic pitch demon calling my name . . . Min . . . Min . . . Min . . .

For a bare instant I thought I was back in the jungles of Farise, except that I wasn’t pouring with sweat. A misty mountain chill enveloped me instead, and the smells weren’t the pungent aroma of rotting vegetation and continual rain, but the clean smells of mountain grass and damp thatch afire.

As I emerged from sleep enough (my mind was still foggy from the previous evening’s excesses) to realize that the demon of my dreams was actually the bell, I dully realized the implications: the bell only rang when there was a fire or other emergency.

I groaned miserably into my welcoming pillow, smelling the sweet mountain herbs among the goose down as I tried to marshal my resources. If there was a bell, I reasoned, that meant an emergency, and almost every emergency would call for the assistance of the trusty village Spellmonger.

That’s me. I needed to go to work. Damn it.

Once that thought occurred, my feet – still in my boots, it had been that kind of night – swung over the side of the bed of their own accord and hit the floor in a manner that was entirely offensive to my head’s delicate condition. My feet had better sense than my head, at the time. An emergency at this time of night was almost always a summons for fire duty or some medical issue or a missing goat or something. I had spells for that.

I encouraged my protesting head to work as I rose and shook myself awake. I could smell smoke. So it was probably a fire. The fire would have to be one of the close-by farmsteads, too, because I had spells on the village as a whole to prevent such things within the bounds of the hedgework. But which farmstead? I tried to clear my head for a moment and summon the energy to do a simple detection spell. It took a moment to happen – magic and alcohol don’t mix well.

This sort of spell is easy, and it doesn’t take much energy, thank Ishi, because at the time I didn’t have much. It’s the sort of thing I do all the time – and fire is a lot easier to detect than lost goats. I held my hands about two feet apart and a rough mental map of the village swam before me for my inspection.

It was an image in three dimensions, it could only be seen by employing magesight, and it was a spell that had become a familiar tool during my six-month tenure in the rustic mountain hamlet of Minden’s Hall. It had taken weeks of constant study, walking every inch of the tiny village and meeting every person who lived within, but the resulting map the spell manifested was as complete a representation of the village as I was capable of crafting.

Fire is the easiest element to detect, and my wards were a point of professional pride – I’m really good with fire spells, so there should be no fire. While my protection runes were loosely wrought enough to allow for some flame (else nothing inside the village would ever get cooked) the wards should have quickly extinguished any serious-enough fire with the intensity necessary to burn damp thatch.

Unless something had pushed through my wards.

That thought sobered me another measure, and I wisely decided to investigate a bit before plunging headlong into the night. My inspection of my wards in magesight was clear: there were several areas of excitement that should not have been there, had my wards remained intact. Before the implications of that really set in, I heard the first of the screams: a high, panicked, girlish voice – that stopped abruptly.

I had heard screams like that before, in the jungle villages of Farise, thousands of leagues south of here. A scream of fear and panic and terror, of being woken up in the middle of the night to the sight of violence and blood. The first time I’d heard it, it had been when I’d helped attack a village of peasants whose lords were on the wrong side of the war. You don’t forget that sound.

My feeble brain knew it was unlikely to be bandits. The village of Minden’s Hall lays within Boval Vale, as peaceful a land as I’d ever seen, high in the western mountains and remote from the trade routes that bandits were traditionally attracted to. Any self-respecting bandit wouldn’t starve here, but he wouldn’t prosper. The local people had little more than cheese and cattle to steal.

Professional soldiers or unemployed mercenaries were also unlikely. It wasn’t unknown for mercenary companies between engagements to occasionally sack a village out of boredom and need for loot, but there weren’t any mercenaries closer than the next barony, or the town of Tudry, leagues to the east, as far as I knew.

I quickly dismissed the idea of an inter-house war as well. The local lord, Sire Koucey of House Brandmount, was a kindly, mature nobleman who didn’t seem to have any enemies that I could see. He and his younger brother, who held the smaller portion of his domain, got along like brothers were supposed to. Nor was the distinguished old knight engaged in a feud, his borders were unthreatened by his noble neighbors.

That left two possibilities: a peasant uprising (which seemed highly unlikely – I’d never seen peasants so pleasantly free and content as those in Boval) or . . .

Oh, crap.

There was only one other possibility. I cursed savagely and reached for my weapons belt. And I was suddenly very much awake.

I hadn’t touched my weapons harness in months. The last time was to move it from the foot of my bed to a peg on the wall, and I hadn’t even bothered to draw my sword – a slender, utilitarian Army-issue mageblade. It was even getting a little rusty. A spellmonger in a remote mountain village just doesn’t have occasion to use a warmage’s tools. That’s why I was way the hell up here in the middle of nowhere in the first place.

As impressive as a warwand or mageblade might be to the rubes, as tools they were rarely useful for removing warts, discouraging rats from nesting, or finding lost cows – which is how I spent most of my professional time these days.

If I’d had my way, they would have stayed on the wall til the spells faded and the leather rotted. But the leather slipped easily into my hand, and I could feel the tingle of magic from the warwands like I was back in the Army again. And I hated that feeling. I moved out to the country in the first place anticipating a long, boring, prosperous existence capped with a peaceful and dignified death in my sleep. I’d had enough excitement in battle for two lifetimes, and I wanted boredom by the fistful instead. Not ringing bells, burning thatch and screams of terror.

As I strapped on the belt I shouted in the darkness for my apprentice, my head painfully regretting rousing him even as I did it. Tyndal was a good lad, a local boy I’d discovered working in a stable when I’d first arrived here.

He was quite Talented at the art of magic for his age, but he was completely inexperienced at this kind of thing. Indeed, at fourteen summers, he was completely inexperienced in most things. But I knew that if I didn’t put his idle hands to work doing something useful he would feel obligated to rush outside to defend his village, and probably get himself killed in the process. And since I had just started getting him trained up decently, that would be a horrible waste of an apprentice.

Considering his weight and size, he was also at least as drunk as I was – a local farmer, Goodman Tilleb, had paid me three big earthenware jugs of the local cider for enchanting his scarecrow to repel cornworms as well, and I had quite generously shared the take with Tyndal. Three quarters of a jug had passed our lips and inspired a long and witty debate about a subject that I could not seem to recall (although I clearly recall being witty about) before sleep took us just a few hours before. We were paying for it now.

Tyndal sputtered and waved pointlessly at the air before the next wiggle of my toe succeeded in bringing him back to the land of the living. He rose from his cot (still dressed and wearing his boots), eyes bleary with sleep, but with expressions of confusion, excitement and fear vying for victory on his face.

“The . . . bell?” he asked, unsteadily.

“Tyndal, get up!” I whispered harshly. “But quietly!”

“Fire? There’s a fire?” he asked, his eyes swimming with confusion and alcohol.

“Not a fire – not a serious one – I checked. But something’s happening outside, something unpleasant.”

I crept over to the window and cautiously peered down from the second story of my shop, out into the dirt track the locals called a street. I saw menacing shadows moving through the moonless night, and heard growls, shrieks, and more muted screams peppering the night. I employed the magesight spell, which had the useful side-effect of letting me see in the dark, though not nearly as well as real daylight did.

I could see the shapes below were moving with organized menace, creeping quietly from house to house, weapons in hand. And there were a lot of shapes down there, lurking in the darkness. I counted ten, and from the screams there were many more. I repeated my earlier curse in a whisper and fell back before any of them could see me.

Tyndal was crouched nearby, wide-eyed with a fear that was magnified by drunkenness and compounded with confusion. I nodded reassuringly to him, and he relaxed a bit. Then he got nervous again when I pulled a spare warwand from a sheath behind my back and tossed it to him. He caught it automatically, and stared at it as if it were a foreign thing.

“It has four charges. If you need to defend yourself, just point it and say the command word: guerestra. Old Imperial for ‘camp follower’,” I explained. “But you’re gonna have to mean it, if you want it to work. Don’t hurt yourself with it. Can you use a bow?”

“Huh? Who is it? What is it? Bandits?” he asked, alarmed, ignoring my quesiton. He crawled over to the window and peeked out. Not the smartest thing to do. I should have stopped him, I suppose, but I was too busy getting armed. I shook my head as I crept over to one of my trunks. “Not likely. We’re too remote for any serious bandit, much less a band of them. I think it’s more likely that it’s—”

“Goblins!” my apprentice shrieked, his voice breaking and his eyes white with fear. He had reached the same conclusion as I by the simple expedient of looking out the window. “Master, a whole army of ’em! At least thirty! They’re attacking everyone and burning—”

“Keep your fool voice down!” I commanded. “And get away from that window! Goblins might be poor shots and unused to archery, but your fat head will be too big a target to miss!” He dropped down below the sill, breathing heavily, his eyes wide with fear and excitement. “Can you use a bow?” I repeated as I took my short bow out of the trunk and began stringing it.

The boy nodded, wide-eyed. I figured he could. From what I had seen the Bovali peasants as a class were well-acquainted with the bow, if not adept. Most lads up in the reaches spent their summers among the pastures, keeping the cows in order and keeping the wolves at bay with a bow. There was also some incredible hunting this deep in the Wilderlands, and the famed Wilderlands longbow was a notoriously powerful and accurate weapon, in the hands of someone who had the strength and skill to wield it.

I handed him mine, much shorter than the local standard, and pushed the quiver after it. He seemed a lot more comfortable with it than the warwand.

“Goblins!” he repeated in a dazed, disbelieving whisper as he hung the quiver and strung the bow.

Goblins.

Around most places in the West, particularly the Wilderlands regions of Alshar and Castal, they are called “goblins.” In other places where their race interacts with humans they’re known as “scrugs,” “hairy folk” or most commonly “mountain folk.” To the ancient Imperials they were known as the casadalain, the “Low People of the West;” they call themselves simply gurvani, “the people.”

Standing no more than four or five feet tall, these little little furry black creatures live a crude tribal existence, traditionally inhabiting caverns or crude villages in remote mountain valleys or stony barrens in the Western Wilderlands – like the one I lived in – and to a lesser extent, the mountain chains of the north, the Kuline range to the east, and the jagged peaks of the Farisian peninsula to the south. They will sometimes move into arable land no humans are using to practice some very primitive horticulture, but they hunted and gathered and mined more than farmed.

Ordinarily they keep to themselves, rarely leaving their vales and caverns except to hunt and trade, or for serious goblin business, whatever that might be. Mostly they leave us bigger and stronger humans alone. Occasionally, however, some tribal leader will get them roused up enough to stage raids against human settlements for cattle and swine and loot. Very occasionally, a strong enough leader has risen to lead confederations of tribes against humans in force.

They knew how to fight, after a fashion. The Goblin Wars, which ended almost two hundred years ago, was the last time that sort of thing had happened. Since then they haven’t been much of a threat to anyone. Most folk in the East consider them little more than animals, if they think of them at all.

Despite popular opinion, goblins are easily as intelligent as humans and some even have a surprisingly strong talent for magic. I had witnessed the power of gurvani shamans the Duchies had allied with a few times in the mountains of Farise, back during the campaign. They weren’t slouches when it came to magic, and some were as deadly as a human warmage.

As I hurried to arm myself I prayed to Isha and Briga and Trygg that I would not be facing one tonight, hungover and tired. The gurvani style of magic is crude, by Imperial standards. So are the iron maces they carry. Both are also extremely effective.

It wasn’t that I wasn’t confident I wouldn’t prevail against a shaman. I just wasn’t in the mood. I just wanted to go back to bed or throw up, the cider in my stomach protesting all this vigorous activity.

When I was dressed in my harness I took only a few more moments to locate the box of knives, darts and daggers that completed my arsenal. I kept imagining my Training Ancient screaming in my ear as I did so, yelling about how slow I was and how many people were dying because I wasn’t moving with more alacrity.

I tried to ignore it and focus on what I was doing. There was no time to distribute my weapons properly, so I pushed a sack of iron spikes into my belt pouch, tucked a dagger behind my back, and tossed a gaudy foot-and-a-half-long Farisi war-knife I’d acquired as a souvenir to Tyndal. He looked nervous and scared as he automatically caught it, but he was ready to follow his fearless master into the night, where the screams were picking up in frequency and volume and the demon disguised as an alarm bell was ringing ever more frantically.

It occurred to me that an apprentice who was frozen with fear and ill with drink would be little use in his first fight. There isn’t much I can do to bolster the resolve of someone else before battle, outside the magical equivalent of a pep-talk, but I could at least mask more of the symptoms of drunkenness.

I grabbed his face, looked deep into his eyes, summoned a little more power and whispered a charm over him. His eyes came into focus and color returned to his cheeks. I included myself in the charm and immediately began to feel better. It didn’t get rid of our hangovers – but it did make us not notice so much. I added a spell of alacrity for myself, on the premise that I would need quick wits and sharp reflexes before dawn. Tyndal looked relieved. He was still scared – Briga, so was I! – but he was less likely to pass out, now.

When I turned toward the door I once again realized that I was a bit drunk myself as the room swam. I was just feeling better about it. I almost took the time to do a more thorough job on myself, but I didn’t want to waste any more energy than necessary. This wasn’t the first time I would fight hung-over. I kind of think it gives me an edge. I could be fooling myself, too.

“Thank you, Master,” he said gratefully. “What should we do, now?” Tyndal asked, his voice breaking and his eyes darting around wildly.

I looked at him oddly. “Goblins are attacking our village. We go fight them, of course,” I said as I threw open the door to the stairs below. “Let’s go!”

As I left the bedroom I held out my hand and called my staff and it floated obligingly to me. It’s a built-in spell that takes hours and hours to do, requires a ridiculously expensive piece of yellow knot coral to work, but the effect is incredibly impressive to the average ignorant peasant.

Most magi carried a staff – it’s a symbol of our profession, much like our silly hats – and most spellmongers kept a useful array of spells on them for emergencies. Being a former warmage, mine had more nastiness than most, including a number of useful defensive spells. I hadn’t bothered to refresh them recently and wondered idly if the spells were sour yet. Like bread, magic can go stale. I could always hit someone over the head with it, I decided.

The two remaining wands on my sword belt were far more deadly than my staff. I took just a moment to make certain they were there and at the ready. One slim willow wand, about fourteen inches long, stained dark with linseed oil and sweat and covered in carefully inscribed runes, was capable of launching at least a score of slender bolts of magical force (about the size of an arrow, with similar effect) against which few mortal armors were proof. The thick oaken wand on the other side of my belt could deliver a massive wave of force akin to being struck by a kicking horse, and could do so two dozen times before it was exhausted.

I hadn’t used either one in over a year, but the magical tingle I felt as I drew the willow wand from its scabbard told me that time had not dimmed their effectiveness. If magic can go stale like bread, then war spells are more like hardtack than bread.

We paused by the door to gather our wits and draw weapons – Tyn clumsily nocked an arrow and I took an instant to caress the cloth-wrapped hilt of my magesword – Slasher, I had named it – across my shoulders and adjust the harness. It occurred to me that six months as a well-fed village Spellmonger seemed to have caused my harness to shrink a bit. Then I opened the door and we pushed outside.

All was chaos. I’ve been in better-organized riots.

People screamed in terror at shadows, and the shadows screamed fearlessly back. Fires were starting to erupt from a few of the homes, despite my carefully laid spells, as people panicked and spilled lamp oil or dropped torches in panic. And something was still pecking relentlessly against my warding spells, I could feel it.

We burst through the door and into the street, wands blazing and arrows flying. I elected to toss my staff like a spear into the back of the head of a passing gurvani, his club raised angrily to the height of my heart. I grabbed a wand as I felt an arrow whiz past my shoulder. The willow crackled and hissed in my hand as it sent two invisible bolts into the furry pelt of the next goblin I saw, half-turned in surprise at our sudden appearance.

Nor was he alone. Tyndal’s first shot had caught one in its narrow jaw, a painful and annoying but not mortal blow, but he was screaming and had dropped his weapons and was an easy enough target to finish off. The third looked at me, dumbfounded by the sudden assault. He and his mates were crouched over the body of someone on the street before we interrupted, probably looting it.

I took two steps toward them and nearly slipped. When I glanced down I saw the body of Goodman Horlan, a cheesebuyer, separated by a few feet from the top of his head. I had skidded in his brains. It took me a moment to realize it, and by that time – luckily for me -- my body had already taken over before my stomach could react.

I had helped Horlan unload a few blocks of salt just this morning. Now I was treading on his brains. And now I was really angry.

So were our invaders, as a few more darted from the shadows and attempted a countercharge.

Automatically I dropped the willow wand and drew my blade as I “called” my staff back to my hand to throw a defensive spell – nothing serious, just a “you stay away!” type of thing. It’s not a battlestaff, after all. But even noncombative wizards put some simple offensive and defensive spells on their staves in case of bandits, beggars, or irate clients, if they’re wise. Being a former warmage, mine were just a little more . . . thorough than most.

It wasn’t enough to stop a charge, not really, and I was soon fighting hand-to-hand. My sword clanged on the iron haft of his weapon, and before I knew it I was face to face with my little black-furred attacker.

The specimen in front of me was about four and a half feet tall, naked save for a leather belt and iron ornaments, covered in a matte of thick black hair that was shiny in the fire light with fresh human blood. His face was full of fangs and rage as he growled savagely, and his eyes glowed like a madman’s. In his furry little fingers he gripped a roughly forged iron mace, which was raised over his shoulder as he stopped my blade. He was clearly intending on braining me as he had my late neighbor.

Slasher, thirty-eight inches of enchanted government-issued high-carbon alloyed steel, had stopped his attack, and for a few seconds I remembered everything my swordmaster every told me. With a twist of my wrist I passed the razor-sharp tip cleanly through his throat. I felt a wave of revulsion roll over me as his blood (darker than a human’s, but no less red, hot, or sticky) splashed over my clothes.

It occurred to some part of my brain that less than five minutes ago, I had been peacefully sleeping – this was not my preferred way to wake up. A twist to make sure he wouldn’t wake back up again and we were out of immediate foes.

“Where to, Master?” Tyndal asked, looking around frantically. There was blood and black hair on that Farisi knife.

“Bell tower,” I grunted, scanning the area with magesight to be sure there were no more goblins lurking. “If for no other reason than to silence that godsdamned bell!” That was the rally point for fire or other disaster, and that’s where all the able-bodied men would be gathering. It still hurt my head like a demon. Tyndal nodded and followed me as I plunged into the darkness.

Bodies were starting to litter the street. I passed a few more former neighbors, and a few more former goblins, as I headed toward the next spot of commotion.

The problem was, even with magesight working for me, these little bastards were sneaky. They kept popping out of nowhere, and had I not been prepared I would have had my head bashed in (or at least a kneecap) a few times if I hadn’t been careful and lucky. I slew two more gurvani with Slasher and smashed another one between the eyes with my staff (he rushed me) while Tyndal put an arrow in him, before we ran into the first live human we’d seen, Goodman Miklo, the barber.

He was holding a wooden stool in one hand and a butcher knife in the other as he fended off two of the creatures, his back to his shop and a savage grimace on his face. A third goblin on the ground at his feet told me that he had been luckier than Goodman Horlan. He fought pretty well for an untrained barber, but I knew that he couldn’t hold out for long. He had a wife and three young daughters to protect, though, and I knew he’d go down before he’d retreat if I didn’t intervene. Besides, we’d need his medical skills for the wounded – if any survived the night.

I decided it was a pretty good time to announce my presence with authority, the way they taught me at War College. I raised my staff and sent a very pretty and barely destructive wad of magical sparks at Miklo’s attackers. It’s a bandit warding spell I’d hung on the staff almost two years ago. Seconds later the gurvani were writhing on the ground in agony while their nervous systems fired randomly. It would only last a few seconds, but it was enough time for Miklo. He didn’t hesitate. He carefully stabbed both of them through the neck, and then smashed the second one in the head with his stool for good measure.

Miklo stared at me in wonderment as he surveyed the dead bodies, the bloodied stool still in his hand. I nodded reassuringly, made sure he wasn’t wounded or going into shock, and encouraged him to join me.

He nodded firmly, once he saw someone else was in charge, and said something to his family behind the door. I heard the heavy bar being lowered behind it. Miklo stooped to pick up a longish curved blade from the twitching gurvani’s dead hands. Despite the smaller handle, it was longer and had more heft than a butcher knife, which he passed back inside to his terrified wife.

Poor Miklo moved as if through an unreal dream, his face blank. I’ve seen that look before – the expression of someone who has never seen violence suddenly thrust into a violent situation. I wore it myself, once.

I stopped long enough to put a cantrip – that’s a small, simple, easy spell like lighting a fire or heating up water or something that you’ve practiced so often that you can almost do it in your sleep – that would make it nearly impossible to open his door.

“To keep your family a little safer,” I explained, when he asked. “Let’s collect some more and head for the bell tower,” I ordered.

We collected Goodman Bru, who we found standing at the door of his harness shop with a long cheese knife freshly stained with dark blood held menacingly in his hand. Bru wasn’t in a daze – he was fighting mad. He’s got a reputation in Minden’s Hall for hard dealing and a quick temper, and he was full of both tonight. He happily joined us, and we continued toward the village’s belltower.

We saw plenty more bodies of both species along the way. I stepped over them as casually as I could – I’d learned to cultivate an indifference to casualties in Farise – and continued on, while my fellow villagers took turns crying and vomiting when they weren’t fighting for their lives.

Arstol the Saddlemaker joined us next, armed with an antique, rusted sword, and then the five of us took on a large knot of the invaders who were just leaving the house of Jowdi the Jolly. They had blood on their fangs, and I didn’t want to think about what they had been doing to the friendly family inside.

We blindsided them with a force and ferocity one might not expect from peaceful mountain villagers. I had to stop my little band from continuing to punish the dead gurvani’s corpses and encourage them to move on – there were others to be slain that night, no need to linger over the dead. We couldn’t waste time on idle vengeance. We made for a shed which gave us the illusion of cover and paused for a moment to get our bearings.

I could hear them all breathing heavily from the exertions of the fight as I again brought my magemap into view, and noted that the largest concentration of the gurvani was around the bell tower, where we were headed. There were plenty of stray goblins between them and us, but there were plenty of people, too.

Two more villagers came up behind us (and were almost accidentally shot by Tyndal) while we waited, Goodman Guris and his son Gusdal. Both held Wilderlands bows and hatchets. They slapped the others on the back and turned to me – for whatever reason – expecting orders.

I gave some. No one told me not to. But I kept it short and simple. “There are two more around this corner, then three in the house beyond that. We go as a group, and we don’t leave anyone behind. Rally anyone else you see to us. Keep your eyes open for shadows. Let’s go!”

The next ten minutes turned into a frantic, confusing, running house-to-house battle, and we were victorious each encounter – as a group, we were starting to out-number the little bands of three or five who were raiding and pillaging. Better yet, along the way we picked up another four men, and all of a sudden we were a military unit and I found myself elected Captain. I was admittedly the most qualified, but I wished someone else would come along and take over.

But while we were winning the individual engagements, my men were taking wounds that real soldiers would have avoided – like Gusdal hacking into his own leg accidentally with his hatchet and Bru’s hand getting opened up by a goblin’s rusty iron dagger. We slowed as we approached the commons, and by the light of our burning homes we saw a horrible sight.

The belltower was the scene of the real siege, though it was more riot than battle. There were about a hundred gurvani tribesmen in the square, throwing stones and javelins at the few people who’d managed to make it inside the rough stone building.

As a fortification, it was a poor choice. It was only a three stories tall, of undressed local stone, and there wasn’t room inside for more than a dozen folk. But it was also the only reasonable choice, as it had stout walls and a thick oaken door bound in iron. And at least one of the besieged was hanging on that bell for dear life to summon help. Mothers screamed for their children, children screamed for their parents, and some screamed for their lives as goblin maces smashed at the knees and feet of those brave or desperate enough to try to escape.

Occasionally, the men would throw the rocks and javelins back down at the invaders, and someone with a bow in the tower was making good use of it . . . but mostly the villagers just hid and screamed in terror.

My little band halted by the edge of the village square and I motioned for them to take cover behind a barn while I took stock of the tactical situation. I had never expected to use that term again, but my time in the service of the Duchies had made me automatically think of such things at a time like this. It was amazing – I hadn’t been in battle in years, yet it all came flooding back to me as if I’d just mustered-out. The constant looking around, the attention to arcane detail, the purposeful extension of awareness . . . all of the warmagi’s tools came to me so easily. Too easily.

Well, at least I was in command this time.

I had maybe six or seven men, mostly with improvised weapons and no combat experience. Oh, each had trained in the village militia, of course, but in this remote province that was as much ceremony as it was training for war. These men were shopkeepers and artisans, not warriors. They were also running on fear, anger and adrenaline, which are not the best ways to approach combat. Several of them wanted to go ahead and attack the band of goblins right then, but I urged them to be calm . . . and Ishi’s tits, they actually listened.

While attacking the foe in the rear sounds glorious in theory, they outnumbered us significantly enough that our glorious gesture would be futile. Even warmagic wouldn’t turn the tide against such odds, not by myself. I could drain my wands and staff at them and there would still be more than enough of them to defeat us. The best we could do was pick off stragglers and wait for help.

The local lord of the valley, Sire Koucey, had built his castle only three or four miles away, and the bell – which continued to ring desperately – could be heard from there. True, he and all of his gentlemen men-at-arms would only add a dozen and a half defenders to the fray, but they were a dozen and a half well-trained, well-armed and mounted troops. Compared to the few shopkeepers and craftsmen, that was as good as an army. Wisdom dictated we sit tight and wait for reinforcements. Only nobody wanted to be wise that night.

“That’s Lida!” Gusdal shouted, spotting a girl he fancied in the bell tower. He started toward her automatically, but his father restrained him before I could.

“Enough, lad!” the elder whispered harshly. “We’ll get them all back proper if we keep our heads. Rushing in there will just get you and her killed. Let’s see what the Spellmonger has up his sleeve!”



He wasn’t the only one who was eager for that. I was kind of curious myself.

“What should we do?” Arstol asked in a whisper. Confused faces looked around for an answer and then looked to me – the relative stranger with the sword – for leadership. Hell, I didn’t know what to do.

While we were trying to figure it out we were joined by another small group of three – farmers with pitchforks and axes – and again a moment later by four more with mauls and picks and other improvised weapons. They were making all manner of unlikely suggestions for taking the attack to the enemy, and I foresaw a lot of stupidity. If left to their own devices, people would get themselves killed. It was time to be a leader.

“Pick them off,” I said confidently, smiling and trying to look bloodthirsty. “Arstol, you take three axe-men and go to the other side of the barn. Kill any of them that try to get around our flank that way. In fact, I’m going to try to lure a few your way. When they get to that side, come out screaming like Korbal himself was chasing you. The rest of you wait until they turn – and they will – and then hit them from behind.” It sounded like a good plan to them only because they knew nothing about warfare. Still, any plan was better than this chaos.

I stuck my head back around the corner and reactivated my magesight to see them in the dark. I picked out a small group of goblins on the edge of the mass, slightly separated from the others. They looked bored with what they were doing, so I gave them something else to think about.

“Archers with me!” I commanded, rounding up the few bowmen, including Tyndal. “Listen carefully. I’m going to count to ten. I imagine you all can count that high. On three, step out into that space between the barn and the house – that will give you a field of fire on the largest group of them, the ones guarding the gates. Try to keep to one straight line. On Five, nock arrows. On Seven, fire. On Nine you turn and come back here. Very simple. Ready? One!”

As I chanted my archers performed more or less as they were supposed to, although their timing was not the best. Still, they sent a flight of shafts at our foe at the same time I opened up with both wands. At least half of them hit, from the screams. By “ten” we had retreated to safety in good order and awaited a reprisal.

Sure enough, a band of ten or so dark furries loped across the commons toward our position. When they were out of sight of the rest of their brood Arstol and his axe men lept out at them, bellowing at the top of their lungs. Half the crew panicked immediately and turned to flee. The other half was paralyzed enough by the confusion to get caught by the mob of villagers at my command. The archers didn’t let anyone escape.

“Ten down, ten times that to go,” I said, grinning. “Alright, let’s see if we can do that again. No arrows this time – we only want a piece of them, not the whole army! I’ll do the leading, the rest of you do what you did last time.” With that I sheathed my wands and brandished my staff as I slipped around the corner.

Now, my staff is not a warstaff, as I have said. It is a perfectly ordinary magical tool that is very useful for making a light in the dark, judging the depth of puddles, and impressing the locals with my mystical wisdom. One doesn’t go to War College, though, without picking up a little of the rampant paranoia that flies around so liberally there. While the tool wasn’t a full-fledged warstaff, I had put a few special enchantments on it. The current situation justified my efforts. I had the perfect spell.

This one is fairly subtle, and I was unsure if it worked on gurvani, but it was worth the attempt. Upon my silent command it releases a tendril of magical energy that gets into the target’s brain and tells them “hey, there’s something over here that needs to be looked at!” It’s a distraction spell that we used in the jungles of Farise to eliminate sentries or remove pickets from their posts. As it turns out, the goblins were just as susceptible, and a largish clump of eight or nine got caught in it. In moments they were shuffling towards the far side of the barn with what I expect were the gurvani equivalent of blank looks on their faces.

I took my place with the main force and waited. As the last of the gurvani passed the edge of the barn, all three axe men launched themselves at their backs, Arstol in the lead with his rusty old broadsword. It was enough of a distraction to break the spell, but by that time the goblins were whirling confusedly, trying to figure out just why they were there in the first place – which gave my belligerent shopkeepers and artisans an opportunity to lay into them.

We managed to slaughter all of them with only two minor injuries. The townsfolk were elated at the minor victory, and I had to keep them from cheering loudly. I would have felt better about it if we taken care of more than a drop in the bucket.

Our melee attracted attention from both the gurvani and a few other straggling townsfolk. We picked off another three goblins as they tried to figure out what was happening, and we collected three more men, another one with a bow. That heartened me – with our smaller numbers, more missile weapons would be welcome.

Which got me thinking . . .

“Arstol, good work! Now, take your axemen and as many volunteers as you can find and make your way around to the other side of the belltower. Kill anything that has more hair than you do!”

That brought a round of laughs and catcalls – Arstol was a hairy, hairy man.

“Once you get to the far side take up defensive positions – behind buildings, through windows, whatever – just make sure your backs are covered. Collect whoever else you can along the way. You, archer – Goodman Henir? Stay here with Tyndal; I’ll need you two to cover me. When your men are in position, Arstol, give a holler. I’m going to get these bastards riled up, and then I’m going to scare the shit out of them! Be ready to slay as many as possible.”

Arstol nodded like he knew what I was talking about and started picking volunteers. Nearly everyone wanted to go. That was fine. The whole point of sending off the erstwhile “taskforce” was to get them out of the way and keep as many of them as possible from getting hurt.

A few stayed with me, and we kept ourselves busy by ambushing whatever gurvani nosed around the side of that barn. The archers and I took turns sniping, they with bows and me with my warwand, while we waited. Eventually I heard the shout from Arstol, and I prepared my spell.

It was sheer bluff. My warwand was running out of power and my staff only had a few useless enchantments left on it. But the rank and file gurvani aren’t too bright, and I was counting on this. I had the archer, Henir – a lad of sixteen, the son of the town weaver – tie an oil-soaked cloth to an arrow and send it sailing to the near edge of the invader’s siege. It stuck there, unnoticed except for a few curious goblins, and burned pitifully.

But long enough. I summoned as much power as I could, draining every reserve in my staff, and fed oxygen to that little flame until it was consuming the entire arrow. Then I started altering the flow of power to craft an illusion. Before three deep breaths had passed, a “fire giant” nine feet high had sprung into life behind the gurvani troops, lighting their hairy backs with a bright yellow flame. It was a crude illusion -- I was expending control of detail for size – but it was effective. Fire is the easiest element to sculpt, after all.

One moment the tribesmen were wailing against a few miserable peasants in a rickety stone tower, the next they were being attacked by a flame demon from some forgotten hell. The light from my illusion illuminated the village square, and for the first time I saw the true numbers of the invaders, somewhere around a hundred and fifty, I guessed.

It was a fairly simple cantrip to add a loud voice to the giant. I knew only a few phrases in gurvani, none of which was appropriate to the occasion, but I also knew that many of the little buggers also spoke a dialect of the speech of the Tree Folk, with whom they were known to trade.

“Sala vadu nestu kala!” I shouted through the spell. I come as Death to defilers of my people! It was a line from the Tree Folk epic Kaladarbu, which I doubt any of the gurvani had read. Hell, few humans outside of my profession had read it. It doesn’t translate well, as the Tree Folk only use writing to humor us.

The effect, however, was beautiful. One gurvan with more courage than sense ran at the “demon” with his little axe, swinging mightily. He overextended himself and landed in a heap, his fur smoldering from the encounter. A few javelins passed through the figure, leaving it undamaged. I willed my creation to take another step forward, knowing that it wouldn’t last much longer. The mass of black furry faces looked up at it in terror, and a few openly broke and ran away.

“Send a few shots at the front of the group,” I whispered to Henir. He nodded and launched four arrows in rapid succession against them. Three hits, one probably fatal. It was enough to convince a few more to run. I’d hoped for more. I could almost feel their fear preying on their minds, encouraging them to run away, back to the holes that spawned them.

But there always has to be a hero in the crowd. A large gurvani, clothed in black leather armor (which was unusual) and wearing some befanged animal’s skull for a helmet, leapt in front of the crowd and yelled something in their gibbering tongue. I didn’t know exactly what, but I guessed it was something along the line of “Don’t run away you cowards! It’s only a fire demon!”

Tyndal took the opportunity to put an arrow into his thigh just as I made the flame man reach down and “grab” the leader. To his credit he did not bolt from either the arrow or the fire. He swung his war club bravely at the thing’s “head,” ignoring the pain from his thigh.

For a moment, it might have worked. He had the attention of the gurvani and was proving that a little illusion was nothing to be afraid of. They started growling and chanting and waving around their weapons, even as their war leader’s pelt started to burn. I was expending every last ounce of energy I had to keep the illusion going, and was about to run out.

Then the cavalry rode over the hill . . .

Literally. The knights of Sire Koucey had arrived in the proverbial nick of time, some two-dozen strong, lances and swords flashing in the light of my fading illusion. Just as my fire-beast dispelled, the first horseman, Sir Cei the Castellan by his device, rode bravely into the midst of them, skewering the leader on his lance with deadly efficiency. I watched with professional respect as he dropped it with the still-writhing gurvan on its tip and drew his sword while his warhorse reared and began stomping on screeching bodies. I’m not a knight and never wanted to be one, but it was undeniably impressive to watch a man work his trade like that.

The rest of the troops, each bearing the white bull on a green field on their shields and banners, followed closely behind in a wedge formation. Seeing their salvation at hand, my stupid villagers, eager to participate in the coming victory, decided to wade into the rear of the invaders’ chaotic formation swinging their farm-implements as effectually as possible. I considered drawing my own sword and wading in, but I had seen enough blood today.

Besides, I felt something . . . there. At the far end of the mass of fur, blood, and bodies was a single gurvan, who seemed undisturbed by the rout that was taking place. Instead he was waving his arms like he was swatting flies. I reactivated my magesight and he lit up like a beacon.

A shaman. And by the amount of magical “glow” he gave off, I could see he was a potent one, perhaps the most powerful one I’d ever seen. That at least explained how the gurvani managed to sneak through the wards that surrounded the village without detection. I’d placed the wards myself, and they would have been sufficient against your average bandit, but I had not thought we needed a more rigorous defense against magical attack.

A good shaman, or even halfway decent hedgemage, for that matter, could cut through the ordinary wards like strings. This shaman was at least that good, and I could tell by the obscene amount of power he was drawing that he was preparing a nasty surprise for Sire Koucey and his iron-clad boys.

“Henir, Tyndal, quickly, loose every shaft you have against that one . . . there. The tallest one. Do it, boys!” I shouted. Their arrows were probably going to be ineffectual, but it was possible that they could distract the shaman long enough for me to do something useful.

I had just a few tricks left up my sleeve. My warwand was effective against nonmagi, but magically defending against such a straightforward attack was pretty easy if you knew it was coming. Anything more potent would require power, and lots of it, and I had blown most of my reserves on that fire-giant. The only thing left was . . .

Shit. I’d thought I’d never have to do this again.

When most people think of a warmage (those who actually do think of such things that is) they think of a regular wizard throwing spells in combat. That much is true, of course, but our training at the War College was a lot more extensive than that.

We were also taught how to be effective combat soldiers in our own right, to keep from needing infantry bodyguards while we were in battle, and to give us more of an offensive punch. They taught us certain spells that we could use on our own bodies to make us more efficient for the kind of hand-to-hand fighting that could break out at any time in a combat situation. The techniques are exhaustive to learn, and physically painful – not everyone’s body could take the stress – but once you learn them they become second nature. They are also physically draining. Most warmagi who aren’t masochists only use them if absolutely necessary.

Now seemed like a good time to indulge.

I said the appropriate trigger words, drawing on every last spark of power at my command, and suddenly everything around me was in slow motion. My head hurt from the effect, and my stomach wanted me desperately to throw up what was left of last night’s cider, but I didn’t take notice of my body any more. I was more than mere flesh, for a few glorious seconds.

I dropped my staff and sprinted towards the shaman, moving three times faster than I could possibly have hoped to un-augmented by the spell. Slasher came to my hand unbidden, and a wordless battle-cry erupted from my lips of its own accord. I noticed in passing that I was catching up with one of Henir’s arrows in flight. A gurvan warrior tried to interpose himself between me and my prey, but I left him behind me clutching the stump of his hand in shocked amazement.

The shaman saw me coming, of course. No doubt his magesight was up, as well, in this chaos. He shifted his gaze toward me even as he prepared to release the spell, a defiant grimace on his lips. I guess he thought I was either a knight with some spark of Talent, or a hedgemage with a sword, but he definitely did not expect a fully-trained warmage, or else he would have shifted his spell to a defensive one. They taught us in War College that the all-out offensive attack has a better chance of succeeding than a more cautious approach, and I was testing that theory.

I sliced at his left knee, right shoulder, left side, and his neck in rapid succession while my other hand worked a distracting little flash cantrip. He blocked the first blow, and part of the second. He was still trying to block the third when my thin blade passed between his shoulders and his head, severing the neck neatly. He died before he was aware of the fact, and suddenly I was faced with a dilemma.

Magical power that is summoned and not used can either dissipate slowly, or it can release explosively, depending upon the vessel and a host of other factors. That was what had killed the Mad Mage of Farise during the final assault during the war. He had built up power and then had been deprived of his release mechanism at an inopportune moment. All of that power must be expressed somehow, and in the absence of a powerful mind to control it, magical energy can be pretty volatile. When he blew apart he had taken a good portion of the Citadel with them.

When I realized just how much power the gurvan had summoned I knew that I was in a similar position. It was also likely to take out me, most of the surviving goblins, all of Sire Koucey’s cavalry, and probably half the village unless I could channel it away somehow. It was happening too quickly for me to form an apis, or other thaumaturgical construct to absorb the power. I had to channel it. I still had the remnants of the fire illusion hanging around, and that seemed to be the most convenient thing to do, so I sent it all into one big fire-illusion spell and directed it straight up.

The result was spectacular. A fountain of fire nearly a mile high, and twelve feet across, bursting at its apex in the biggest firework I had ever seen. It lit up the entire village like it was daylight, and it could be seen for miles around. It was so terrifying to the normally nocturnal gurvani that those who were not already retreating bolted and ran as fast as their hairy little legs could carry them.

Me, I collapsed in a heap next to the recently living body of the shaman. I stayed there, catching my breath and waiting for the spell to diminish, until Sire Koucey himself, jingling with every step in his armor and spurs, shook me back to consciousness.

“Excellent job, Spellmonger,” he said, a grin dividing that gray-white mustache and beard, when I regained my senses. “We’ve got them on the run. My knights are chasing them back to their damn holes, but that would have been difficult going without . . . whatever it was you did. Well done!”

I stared up at him for a moment while I tried to make sense of what he said. This seemed to be an occasion that called for a grand and noble gesture. I had just been honored by the lord of the domain, after all. It seemed a good place for ceremony, a gesture, or at least a few thankful words.

When speech was available to me again, I managed to mumble, “Thank you, my lord,” before I bowed . . . and vomited used cider and bile on his boots.





Chapter Two

My History . . . And A Frightening Discovery





Once upon a time, in a tiny village called Talry on the bank of the great river Burine, in the Riverlands Barony of Varune, the Duchy of Castal, a Great and Powerful Mage was born unto a common man and his wife.

I’ll spare you the suspense. It was me.

The place I grew up was a nice, quiet little river-village, where most of the people farmed or fished, a few sold goods and services to those who farmed or fished, and even fewer lived off the taxes paid by those who sold goods and services to those who farmed or fished. It was a pretty little village on the west side of the river, only six miles from the looming Castle Talry, where Baron Lithar made his home.

My father had the baking license for the river village of Talry-on-Burine, and was viewed as a master of his craft by his colleagues as far away as Dresel. His bread was always smoother and tastier than any the farmwomen made, his pies were counted as having no equal, and the fruit-and-honey-cakes he made for holidays were the stuff of legend.

He supplied bread not only to most of the village and the barges that traveled the river, but the Baron’s castellan also sent to him for special dainties that the castle bakery couldn’t produce as well as he could. He was particular good at berry pies, and as a kid I made a small fortune selling “reject” pies out of the back of the shop to my peers.

In any case, due to my father’s incredible ability to take flour, eggs, yeast, milk, and such and transform them into the best breads in the Five Duchies, he thrived. He married my mother, daughter of the miller in Poom Hamlet, upriver fifty miles or more, got his master’s license, secured a grant from Baron Lithar, and began a long lifetime of raising bread and kids in relative prosperity.

As his fame and recognition as a baker increased, so did his fortune, until he had the third largest house in town, a small stable of his own, and the exclusive right to make sweet pies and pastries for a five-mile radius of his shop. He was blessed with a beautiful, hard-working wife and many children.

All girls.

When my eldest sister was born, my mother says he was as excited as any new father. When my sister Litha was born two winters later, he feasted his neighbors on her name-day and spoke expectantly of the son his wife was sure to birth next. Six years and three more daughters later, he had become something of a town joke. With each new pink healthy daughter my mother presented to him, it added to his despair.

Don’t misunderstand – he was a doting father to all of his children, loved each of my sisters dearly, and never once griped about their dowries. But he wanted a boy to pass his craft to. He envisioned a dynasty of great bakers.

He tried everything, to hear my mother tell it. He consulted the Baron’s wizard, the local hedgemage, itinerant witches, birthsisters, and every granny within twenty miles seeking a sure-fire way to ensure male conception. He went so far as to sponsor a festival in the village to Trygg, the Mother Goddess, ostensibly to celebrate my eldest sister’s coming of age, but in reality as a means of begging her priestesses for a boy.

After a decade of nonstop procreation I finally arrived. My father was so happy he could have burst. My mother was just relieved. Six healthy children is a lot to expect from a woman. Not that she minded the attempts – I get my lusty nature from her – but by the time I came along, she was ready to lapse into the role of grandmother.

They named me Minalan, after my maternal great-grandfather, and proceeded to spoil me only as a boy with five older sisters could be spoiled. My childhood was cushy, comparatively speaking. My sisters took turns babying me and torturing me, depending on the sister, her mood, and the position of the stars. Mama was strict but benevolent (she had raised five spirited daughters, so I didn’t get away with much), and Dad tried to be stern but usually ended up being as indulgent to his only son as he was to his daughters.

He did make me work hard, though; running a bakery is hard work in the best of times, and no hands ever went idle. Father worried initially that the over-dose of female attention would soften me, but by the time I was five it was clear that I was as sturdy as hardtack and had the spirit of a spicy pepper roll. Dad relaxed. He had his heir. Until that fateful day.

* * *

When one of the village men shook me awake the next morning, I had been dreaming about Talry and my parents. The sun was well on its way toward noon. Tyndal was snoring beside me, almost as tired as I was from an evening’s work that had not ended until dawn. It was a mark of how exhausted I was that I had not responded to the wards that should have alerted me to his presence the moment he crossed my threshold.

“Begging your pardon, Master Minalan, but Sire Koucey and Sir Cei would like to see you. They’re in Micit’s barn,” he said when I finally came downstairs. With that the villager, whom I didn’t recognize (a thick man wearing a brown woolen cap and tunic that was the unofficial uniform of the Bovali peasants) turned and left. He also wore a thick leather coat over his tunic and carried a five-foot spear like it was a hoe, so I assumed everyone was still on alert from the attack.

I glanced at my snoring apprentice and decided to let him keep sleeping. There was no reason we should both be falling off our feet. I quietly picked up my weapons belt and tip-toed down the stairs, where I took a moment to put myself in order. I put on my ‘business’ cloak, a dark blue woolen mantle that I had paid a local lady to embroider with stars and moons and all sorts of meaningless arcane symbols.

I also grabbed my hat, the standard four-pointed affair that had been a fashion rage three hundred years ago. It was now the unofficial headgear for professional spellmongers and other magi. Three of the points were smaller than the last, and were sewn to the conical center. I felt a little silly wearing it, but the more important the man, the sillier the hat, my father always told me.

I grabbed my staff from where I had dropped it last night and decided I was ready to meet the lord of the land. I tiredly tripped over the threshold as I left the shop, so I stopped and hung a cantrip that would make me appear alert, awake, and refreshed, in utter contradiction to the way I felt. It used nearly every scrap of energy that a few hours of sleep had restored, but I couldn’t appear before His Excellency, Sire Koucey, Lord of Boval Vale and Liege of Brandmont looking like a wastrel.

I was greeted along the way with solemn nods and grateful smiles, and even a bow or two. There was a new respect in the eyes of my neighbors, thanks to my efforts in the attack. Several made a point of thanking me.

Yay, I’m a hero, I thought dully, trying to ignore the wailing cries of those who had lost family in the night, or the moans of the wounded where they suffered from their beds. I saw several men who had fought the previous night, and made a point to nod back to them – they were the ones who deserved the praise.

It’s easy to take a man who has been trained to fight and put him in danger. It is much harder to rise to the occasion when the toughest fight you had ever been in had ended with a mug of cider and nothing more serious than bruises. The thirty-odd victims of the gurvani had been a severe blow in a hamlet so small, but they carried on as if it was the day after Market Day. The stoic mettle of the Bovali impressed me. Many of these sturdy mountain people were going about their business as if nothing had happened at all.

A knot of men-at-arms in the livery of the Lord of Boval Vale – a white cow on a green mountain – were loitering around outside, and I nodded sagely to them as I passed. I was surprised when they snapped into a loose approximation of attention. I just didn’t warrant that kind of thing.

I saluted automatically, and then grinned self-consciously at myself when they returned the courtesy. It had been a while since I had done that.

Lord Koucey and his dour Castellan, Sir Cei were inside, puffing away on their pipes while they looked over the stacked bodies of the raiders. There was a nasty, cloying odor of death, blood, and burnt hair that was truly nauseating. Live gurvani smell fairly pungent, and death does little to help matters. I understood immediately why they were smoking so early in the day. I bowed to the gentlemen before quickly moving to light my own pipe.

“Master Minalan,” the Lord of Boval said around his pipestem in his high, reedy voice. “My thanks for your expert work last night. Had you not rallied the people and plyed your magics as you did, I would have found Minden’s Hall a smoking ruin and been shy several tenants here this morning.” He bowed his silvered head in a gentle salute, revealing the beginnings of a thin patch in the center of his pate.

The Lord of the Vale was a short man, but well-muscled, and he had seen at least fifty summers in this valley. He had sharp, penetrating eyes that held equal measures of intelligence, wisdom and wit. He was also an adept warrior, good with a lance or sword, and an excellent combat leader.

When I had first met him during the Farisian Campaign, he also proved an excellent drinking companion in addition to being a competent officer and a fierce fighter. His men, mostly doughty archers and tough country knights, likewise impressed me both in battle and in camp. He had brought two hundred, mostly peasants retrained as infantry or archers. He had brought more than half of them back from that hellish province, which is more than many commanders from that bloody campaign can say.

When I took him up on his invitation to settle in his remote little valley I became even more taken with the man as a liege. He proved to be a good overlord in peacetime as well as being a good war leader. His people didn’t quite love him, but they did accord him far more respect when he was out of earshot than most nobles warranted from their subjects. In the six months that I had lived here as village Spellmonger, I had witnessed him dispensing judgment and making shrewd decisions that convinced me that he had the best interests of his people and his lands in mind, not his own aggrandizement– a rarity among the nobility anywhere.

Sir Cei, on the other hand, was a tall, hulking, sulking, bitter-faced man of thirty summers or so, a distant cousin of Koucey’s from Gans. Sir Cei was typical of many of the “country gentlemen knights” of the Alshari Wilderlands in most ways, but he had a flair for organization. He was an excellent manager of his lord’s estates despite his famously sour disposition.

He hadn’t accompanied Sire Koucey to Farise (someone had to stay home and tell the peasants what to do, I guess) and I could see now why Koucey had been so jovial on campaign. He may have been an excellent Castellan, but having Sir Cei around was much like being a teenager under the eye of a matronly and disapproving aunt.

“It was my duty and pleasure to serve, my lord,” I said, lighting my pipe by flashy cantrip, and then bowing. That sort of thing impresses the layman, you know. “I am only sorry I could not have saved more of your people.” Almost two score of his subjects were dead, and twice that many were egregiously wounded.

“I blame them, not you,” he grumbled, kicking a black furry corpse with his pointed horseman’s boot, causing his spurs to jingle. I winced when I noted that there was still a large splotchy vomit stain on it. “Particularly that witchdoctor. He was quite potent, it seems, to do so much harm so quickly – though not as tough as our Spellmonger!” Koucey laughed, slapping me appreciatively on the back. I didn’t think it was that funny.

“He was the most powerful mage I have encountered since Farise, my lord,” I said, seriously. “You recall we we encountered the gurvani in the jungles of Faries,” I said. He nodded. He never tired of mentioning the war and the grueling campaign, although he saw it a damn sight more loftily than I recalled. “Their shamans were good, but not nearly that good. That shaman was handling far more power than any single mage in the Duchies. I cannot tell you where he came by it – perhaps he was just abrim with Talent – but that kind of power would have almost classed him as a Master Mage. . .” I trailed off as a horrifying thought suddenly occurred to me.

Farise.

“Quickly, where is his body?”

“Over there,” Sir Cei grunted. “The men wanted to start lopping off heads for warning spikes, but I insisted that all bodies be thoroughly examined first.” Probably for loot, though he was too darn noble to say it. Cei likes being thorough, but he’s also utterly incorruptible. When anyone is watching.

“Excellent,” I muttered absently, and began the unsavory process of hunting through body parts and disemboweled, furry little corpses.

I was looking for one particularly gruesome limb. Thankfully it didn’t take me long to find it. I pulled a leathery black fist, severed midway between elbow and wrist, from under a pile of other discarded body parts. The cut was clean and sharp, which meant it was most likely the one I was looking for. The axes of the villagers and the lances of the horsemen made wounds far less neatly than Slasher.

Carefully I pried the stiff, cold fingers apart. At the center, as I expected and feared, was a centimeter-wide stone of bright milky green, like an emerald only far deeper. It was smooth around most of its diameter but had a rough backside.

I exhaled slowly, and backed away a step. Sire Koucey and Sir Cei had crowded around me, and when I stepped back they jumped as if bitten by the thing. Then they relaxed when it didn’t do anything in particular. Of course, if they knew what it was, they would have headed for the horizon as fast as their feet could carry them.

* * *

I never wanted to be a wizard – indeed, the thought had never occurred to me.

My plans around adolescence centered on finding some way to get Hedi the Miller’s Daughter alone and up her skirts and eventually inheriting the shop some day and baking bread for the rest of my life. Noble goals, these.

But Fate, or Luck, or the Gods had other plans, and about the time I started growing hair in unlikely places and cracking my voice, things just started happening.

I began learning the basics of professional-class baking as soon as I could knead dough. I had a perfectly common boyhood for the first twelve years of my life as my father’s apprentice. Nothing more extraordinary than fights and stolen kisses ever happened, and if I blackened more eyes than I received it was probably because I ate too many cookies and was strong from toting too many bags of flour. And cutting too much firewood.

You might not appreciate just how much firewood a good-sized bakery requires on a daily basis. Dad’s ovens were huge. Between the needs of the castle and the village and the regular contracts for journeybread Dad had with barge captains, he had two large ovens that rose above the roof of our house, and one small one that was still pretty damn big. They were rooms unto themselves, large enough for a man to crawl into to clean (and guess who got that job?).

They dominated the rear of our house, great pregnant-looking domes constructed of wicker and river clay. Dad had painted them the traditional red, of course, and you could see them for almost a mile downriver.

Every morning he (or one of his apprentices) would get up long before dawn and start the laborious process of feeding the fires, banked the previous day. Every third day someone (always one of his apprentices – rank hath its privileges) would climb in with a broom and spade and excavate the mounds of ash before they relit the fire and began stacking wood upon it. It took half a chord of wood to re-heat the large ones back to baking temperature and another half to keep it going all day. We used a lot of wood – Dad employed three families of woodcutters to supply him.

I started toting wood from the shed to the ovens as soon as I was old enough to walk. At first it was fun. Then it was work. Then it was torture. By the time I was twelve I had lugged whole forests of trees into the gaping maws of the ovens.

While I didn’t know it at the time, my magical Talent (or rijara, as the old Imperials call it) was starting to come out.

It was little things, at first, things I didn’t even notice back then. During hide-and-seek I could always find everyone, no matter how cleverly hid, or hide myself so well that I’d never be found. While playing ball games I always knew when and where the ball would be before it got there. Perfectly normal “childhood” magic, the kind that every kid everywhere thinks that they can do.

But in late winter of my thirteenth year things came to a head. I’ll never forget that day as long as I live.

I had spent most of the night fuming about a fight with my youngest sister. Urah and I had always been at odds, largely because we were closest in age. In truth she was no better or worse than my other sisters when it came to alternately teasing and spoiling me. But Urah had a temper, and she often took it out on me when she was fed up at being the youngest girl but not the youngest child.

We fought often, over stupid things, and sometimes it escalated beyond reasonable sibling rivalry and came to blows and nasty tricks. I don’t remember what the particular offense was, but I do recall that she got away with something big and blamed me for it.

As a result, Dad had given me punishment detail for three weeks. In our house there was only one punishment: feed the ovens. That particular day I had gotten up way too early, gulped a cup of hot milk, and stomped out into the late fall chill to begin my torture. I fumed at Urah the entire time.

I stomped my way back and forth between the shed and the ovens, a journey that I had long ago calculated to be twenty-three steps both ways, and on each trip back I held almost as much wood as I could carry. Every step of the way I cursed Urah under my breath. Not a good idea in front of the oven, which is also a shrine to Briga, the Fire Goddess (in Boval they call her Breena, other places Breega, but in Talry she was Briga), but I was pissed off at my sister and figured the goddess would understand.

By trip six (it took nine trips for enough wood to get the fires started) the exercise had warmed me up. By trip eight I had loosened my jacket, and my boyish curses had become audible. At the end of trip nine I stacked wood as if every piece was aimed at my sister’s head. I had worked myself into such a frenzy that I didn’t even realize that I had started a fire.

With magic.

I stood and gaped in horror as the dry poplar and oak sputtered into flame. In moments a roaring fire was making my face uncomfortably hot. Smoke poured out of the oven’s mouth, as it normally did. The fire was spreading evenly from place to place. It was a perfectly laid fire. But I knew for a fact that I hadn’t started it. The spill I would have used was inside the house on the hearth altar yet.

Had Briga heard me? I wondered, horrified that I might have just doomed my sister to a premature and fiery death. I dropped the rest of my wood and started to run away, when I ran smack into my father’s rotund belly. I looked up at him with tears in my eyes, and he looked down at me, concerned.

“I saw the whole thing,” he said, softly. “Get your cloak on and go out to the shed, to my workroom. There are some things you and I need to discuss.”

I nodded, and then remembered my chores. “What about the oven?”

“I’ll get Urah to do it. She should be up by now, anyway. She’ll never catch a man if she stays lazy like that.” I grinned at him, relieved that he wasn’t angry at me.

I grabbed my heavy wool cloak and trudged outside to the woodshed. When you think woodshed, you probably think of a tiny shack just big enough to store a half a chord or so. Perhaps if we were a simple farmstead; my Dad burned so much wood that he required a huge shelter for it.

The entire right side of it was full of firewood, while the left side held my Dad’s workbench and tools, as well as a few extra bags of flour and salt and such. Behind that was Dad’s workroom. Mama may have run the house and shop like a Duchess, but the shed was my Dad’s domain, a place of refuge from his wife and family when he craved solitude.

I was almost as shocked by the invitation as I had been by the magical fire. Dad’s workroom was Forbidden Territory, inviolate, his inner sanctum. It was where Dad kept his records and did his accounts – my father was proud of his literacy and secretive about his money. I found out later that he kept his secret recipe book there, too, the one he claimed didn’t exist, in a brick lined safe under the floor. Mama never even went in there.

To be caught anywhere near it was grounds for a switching. An invitation within had never been extended to any of my kin that I knew of. I waited outside until Dad showed up, not able to bring myself to enter alone. He didn’t speak, just laid a fire in the tiny stove, and poured water into a small tin kettle on top. Two mugs were set out, and I could smell the crushed kafa leaf in their bottoms.

“Well, son,” he finally began in his deep baritone, “it looks like you broke the egg basket on this one.”

“Dad, I don’t know what--”

“What happened? I think I do. But I’ll need a little help to explain it,” and with that he reached up on the top shelf and took down a small, pint-sized earthenware jar.

I knew about that jar. Just about every kid’s dad in the village had one of those jars stashed somewhere where their wives wouldn’t find it. It contained a very powerful distilled liquor that Opa the Woodcutter made to supplement his meager income (regular spirits were available to the folk of Talry, but they were taxed heavily. While Opa’s brew was untaxed and, therefore, illicit, I don’t think the baron or anyone else minded his discreet trade).

Opa brought a new pint every week when he made his regular delivery. Sometimes when Dad had friends over, he’d take them out back to “show them something in the shop,” and they almost always seemed friendlier when they returned.

He pulled the cork and took a deep sip, then handed it to me. I was in shock. This meant I was a man, by the unsophisticated standards of village artisans, and I swallowed repeatedly before I could bring myself to take a drink of the liquid fire. I coughed and sputtered, but Dad expected this and was ready with a cup of water. When I had calmed down (and warmed up significantly) he had me tell him everything I could about the event.

When I was done he took the jar back and stood up, sighing. I sat there silently and watched him putter around, looking behind books and under papers for his pipe and herb pouch. I found watching him comforting. He seemed so calm, and the shock of the earlier event was starting to fade into a dreamlike unreality.

Armed with pipe and pouch, he sat back in his chair and began the ritual of packing it. He also began telling me about my family, on my mother’s side.

Mama’s people were from Poom Hamlet. Twenty-miles upriver and inland another six. But they weren’t from the Castali Riverlands originally. They had re-located there about five generations back from someplace up North, around the Kuline Mountains.

Family history said that they were nobility – legend said royalty – from some long-forgotten petty-kingdom in Wenshar, on the outskirts of the Magocracy. The name Manuforthen was somehow attached to the legend, though if that was the name of an ancestor or the name of the kingdom, no one was sure.

What was whispered, though, was that our ancestors had been magelords, potent magi who had left the borders of the Imperial lands in the East to strike out on their own, away from the power of the Archmage. When the Narasi tribes that were my father’s ancestors swept down from the steppes on the decadent Imperial lands, Mama’s ancestors had fled south. Some of them fled to Poom Hamlet, where they settled down, forgot about magic, and ran the mill.

Dad had never thought anything might come of it – all of Mama’s kin seemed normal enough (except my Uncle Clo, but that’s just the way he is), having intermarried with Narasi over the generations until there was no trace of their Imperial past in their features. No one else seemed to show any signs of magic in their blood – but the possibility was always there, Dad explained. It had always been there, but he and Mama hadn’t taken it seriously. Until now.

“What in six hells is it, Spellmonger?” Sire Koucey demanded. “It must be magical. And deadly. You look as though you’ve seen a ghost.”

“Not far from it, my lord,” I answered, breathlessly, my heart sinking a foot a minute. “That, Sire, is something I haven’t seen since the Farisian campaign. It is something that most wizards live a lifetime and never get to see. The one I saw there was half this size and in the hand of a master sorcerer.”

“It is an enchantment, then?” he asked, having no real idea what he was asking. I answered him as he wanted.

“It is all enchantment, my lord,” I whispered. “And it means trouble for your domain.” And my livelihood, but that wasn’t what I was focused on. I had bigger things to concern me than my clients – indeed, my worst possible fear was realized.

The Imperials called it irionite. My people called them witchstones. It’s a type of green amber found, it is said, in some mountain streams in the Kulines and Mindens. But this innocuous looking little translucent rock was mightier than the foundations of the strongest fortress.

It made a dent in my mind, like a magical fire whose flames warmed the part of me that does magic. These stones were once only nearly-mythical devices. Now they were almost unheard of. Historically, they were extremenly important. Witchstones were the source of power that propped up the ancient and creaking Magocracy for centuries against the onslaught of my barbarian ancestors, after all. And for centuries, it took little more than that.

Irionite magnifies a mage’s natural expression of magic a thousandfold or more. No one knows how, or why – the few specimens that have popped up have presented an irresistible lure to the magi who found them, and all study on the matter is a closely-held and highly-regulated secret – but the barest amount of that milky stone was enough to amplify the powers of the dullest mage. A simple flame cantrip, such as I use to light my pipe, can be turned into a raging inferno with a witchstone. Spells that would ordinarily take hours of preparation and concentration could be done with little effort.

Wars had been fought over the stuff. A lot of them. And recently. The Mad Mage of Farise had killed thousands of soldiers and sailors from the Duchies with a mere sliver of it. To see that milky green pebble in a black and furry hand made me so frightened my bowels turned to water.

“This is going to complicate things.” I said in a voice that was almost a whisper.

* * *

For those of you who weren’t fortunate enough to get an Imperial education in the Art and Science of Magic – and I assume that is most of you – the story of irionite is intrinsically intertwined with the history of the Magocracy, and, by extension, that of the Five Duchies and of all Callidore itself.

The Magocracy evolved on the lost island of Perwyn, a mountainous subcontinent located somewhere in the Eastern Ocean. It was alleged to be the Birthplace of Man, though there are other places that claim to have human settlements at least as old, and most legends say we were spawned from the Void above. But when we arrived, we knew little of magic. The Tree Folk taught us.

The First Archmage, legend has it, united the various tribal magi of Perwyn under his banner at the city of Nomaowi. While he was consolidating political power he also established in writing the basic principals of Magic, convened the first Privy Council of Magi, and founded the first Imperial Academy of Magic. He also fought a successful war against his competitors using his cabal of magi liberally against them. Eventually, through war and negotiation, he dominated the other non-talented factions on the island, and handed his successor a tidy, unified and well-run little kingdom.

He is also, hagiographically speaking, credited with receiving from Yrenitia, Goddess of Magic and Science, the three Great Gifts of Perwyn. The first was the Periodic Table of the Lesser Elements (the Perada, in Old Perwyneese); the second was the Twenty Principals of Magic and the Physical World (the Perinsi); and the third was the basic symbolic system for shaping and channeling magic, which are still in use to this very day (the Padu, for those taking notes). What exactly he did with these gifts is still debated in the rarefied chambers of academia and religion. But whatever he did, the man got results.

For almost a thousand years human civilization flourished on Perwyn. Dynasties of Archmagi ruled (often benevolently) over the island and its associated mainland colonies. Masters of politics and diplomacy as much as magic, they ruled by guile and wit, shrewdness and calculation.

They ruled with the backing of the Dabersi Guards, the elite warmagi who were the Archmage’s personal army. They ruled by maintaining control of the sea-lanes against the pirates of Farise (who were troublesome even when they were a “loyal” province of the Magocracy) and the navies and leviathans of the non-human Sea Folk.

But mostly they ruled because of magic. Using irionite, few non-magical forces could stand up to him. Where did he get it or the knowledge of its use? The most accepted historical theory implicates his alleged involvement and research with the Tree Folk of the Continent.

That ancient race had contact with the coastal colonies that later grew up to become the Greater Magocracy and then the Five Duchies, and the First Archmage was said to have been shipwrecked there in his youth. Some stories say he stole the first Nine Witchstones, others say that they were given to him. Either way, the First Archmage of Perwyn, Cordan I, reigned and ruled with those most potent of artifacts in his hand. Later he placed all nine in the Emerald Staff of the Archmagi, and that just made him and his successors more powerful.

The Staff could do all sorts of wondrous things, such as raising or quelling storms (useful for controlling the sea lanes) and laying waste to enemies with bolts of Blackfire (handy for quelling the occasional rebellion or coup attempt). It was said to have had a voice of its own and was free in offering wise advice to the reigning Archmage – in some cases, the legends and histories hint that the Staff itself played an active role in the scheming politics of Perwyn.

The power was put to the test many times, including the construction of the Twin Towers of Nomaowi, the creation of the Spire of Perwyn, changing the course of the River Ilnoy, and the reclamation of the Samprinso Bay from the sea three centuries after the first Archmage died in office.

That last one was notable because of both its scope, which was godlike, and its failure, which was catastrophic.

For four short years Kephan the Damned, the thirty-second Archmage of Perwyn, basked in the glory of his greatest magical achievement, growing the island’s limited arable land by almost a third. Unfortunately, something went wrong and eventually nearly the whole island plunged back into the depths, leaving only a tiny archipelago of mountaintops to mark the site of the great civilization. After the Inundation the Spire of Perwyn, an ancient gray tower that had been built on the highest point of the island, was the only remaining sign that a civilization ever existed there.

When the survivors regrouped on the mainland, the Staff had been recovered, and the first Archmage of the Later (or Greater, depending upon your view of history) Magocracy began the long slow process of unifying the coastal colonies and rebuilding them into a shadow of Perwyn’s lost glory. Irionite became the means by which the barbarian hordes (my ancestors) were held back, irate nonhumans and rebelling peasants were kept in line, and politics were dominated. The Palace of the Archmagi was built in Reymes using irionite.

It was also the means by which the first of the Mage Wars were fought.

If the old Archmagi of Perwyn had used the stones to unite an empire, they were used by the Magelords of the Later Magocracy to nearly tear one apart. A score of feuding houses, descendents of Perwyn’s displaced nobility, spent two hundred years or so laying waste each other’s holdings in an attempt to grab power from whomever was perceived to have had it.
