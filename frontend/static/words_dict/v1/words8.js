This second use is now much more common than the first use, but it is still believed by some people to be incorrect. Why should this be? People do not criticize other sentence adverbs, e.g. <b>sadly</b> (as in <b>sadly</b> , her father died last year) or <b>fortunately</b> (as in <b>fortunately</b> , he recovered). Part of the reason is that <b>hopefully</b> is a rather odd sentence adverb: while many others, such as <b>sadly</b> , <b>regrettably</b> , and <b>clearly</b> , may be paraphrased as ‘it is sad/regrettable/clear that …’, this is not possible with <b>hopefully</b> . Nevertheless, it is clear that use of <b>hopefully</b> has become a shibboleth of ‘correctness’ in the language—even if the arguments on which this is based are not particularly strong—and it is wise to be aware of this in formal contexts.
