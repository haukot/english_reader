These examples all contain a verb in the <b>subjunctive mood</b> . The subjunctive is used to express situations that are hypothetical or not yet realized and is typically used for what is imagined, hoped for, demanded, or expected. In English, the subjunctive mood is fairly uncommon (especially in comparison with other languages, such as Spanish), mainly because most of the functions of the subjunctive are covered by modal verbs such as <b>might</b> , <b>could</b> , and <b>should</b> . In fact, in English, the subjunctive is often indistinguishable from the ordinary <b>indicative mood</b> since its form in most contexts is identical. It is distinctive only in the third person singular, where the normal indicative <b>-s</b> ending is absent (he <b>face</b> rather than he <b>faces</b> in the example above), and in the verb ‘to be’ (I <b>were</b> rather than I <b>was</b> , and they <b>be</b> rather than they <b>are</b> in the examples above). In modern English, the subjunctive mood still exists but is regarded in many contexts as optional. Use of the subjunctive tends to convey a more formal tone, but there are few people who would regard its absence as actually wrong. Today, it survives mostly in fixed expressions, as in <b>be</b> that as it may; far <b>be</b> it from me; as it <b>were</b> ; lest we <b>forget</b> ; God <b>help</b> you; <b>perish</b> the thought; and <b>come</b> what may."}],"subkingdom":[{"word":"subkingdom","description":{"noun":[{"description":"<div><i>[Biology]</i> a taxonomic category that ranks below kingdom and above phylum or division.</div>"}]},"pronunciation":"/ˈsəbˌkiNGdəm/"}],"sublanguage":[{"word":"sublanguage","description":{"noun":[{"description":"<div>a specialized language or jargon associated with a specific group or context.</div>"}]},"pronunciation":"/ˈsəbˌlaNGɡwij/"}],"sublation":["sublate"],"sublate":[{"word":"sublate","description":{"verb":[{"description":"<div>1. <i>[Philosophy]</i> assimilate (a smaller entity) into a larger one<div>• <i>fragmented aspects of the self the subject is unable to sublate.</i></div></div>","notes":"[with <i>obj.</i> ]"}]},"pronunciation":"/səˈblāt/","origin":"mid 16th cent.
