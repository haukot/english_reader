After being defeated in World War I, Germany was taken over in the 1930s by the Nazi dictatorship that led to a policy of expansionism and eventually to complete defeat in World War II. Germany was occupied for a time by the victorious Allies and was partitioned. The western part (including West Berlin), which was occupied by the US, Britain, and France, became the Federal Republic of Germany or <i>West Germany</i> , with its capital at Bonn. The eastern part, occupied by the former Soviet Union, became the German Democratic Republic or <i>East Germany</i> , with its capital in East Berlin. West Germany emerged as a major European industrial power and was a founder member of the EEC, while the East remained under Soviet domination. After the general collapse of communism in eastern Europe, East and West Germany reunited on October 3, 1990."}],"germ cell":[{"word":"germ cell","description":{"noun":[{"description":"<div>1. <i>[Biology]</i> a cell containing half the number of chromosomes of a somatic cell and able to unite with one from the opposite sex to form a new individual; a gamete.</div><div>2. <i>[Biology]</i> an embryonic cell with the potential of developing into a gamete.</div>"}]},"pronunciation":"/ˈjərm ˌsel/"}],"germ-free":[{"word":"germ-free","description":{"adjective":[{"description":"<div>containing no germs; sterile or clean<div>• <i>an enclosed, germ-free environment.</i></div></div>"}]}}],"germicidal":["germicide"],"germicide":[{"word":"germicide","description":{"noun":[{"description":"<div>a substance or other agent that destroys harmful microorganisms; an antiseptic.</div>"}]},"pronunciation":"/ˈjərməˌsīd/"}],"germinally":["germinal"],"germinal":[{"word":"germinal","description":{"adjective":[{"description":"<div>1. relating to or of the nature of a germ cell or embryo.</div><div>2. in the earliest stage of development.</div><div>3. providing material for future development<div>• <i>the subject was revived in a germinal article by Charles Ferguson.</i></div></div>","notes":"[<i>attrib.</i> ]"}]},"pronunciation":"/ˈjərmənl/","origin":"early 19th cent.: from Latin <i>germen</i> , <i>germin-</i> ‘sprout, seed’ + <a>-al</a> ."}],"Germinal":[{"word":"Germinal","description":{"noun":[{"description":"<div>the seventh month of the French Republican calendar (1793–1805), originally running from March 21 to April 19.</div>"}]},"pronunciation":"/ˈjərmənl/"}],"germinal disk":[{"word":"germinal disk","description":{"noun":[{"description":"<div>another term for <a>blastodisk</a> .</div>"}]},"pronunciation":"germinal disc"}],"germinable":["germinate"],"germinative":["germinate"],"germinator":["germinate"],"germinate":[{"word":"germinate","description":{"verb":[{"description":"<div>1.

This is because adverbs like <b>hardly</b> are treated as if they were negatives, and it is a grammatical rule of standard English that double negatives are not acceptable. Words like <b>hardly</b> behave as negatives in other respects as well, as for example in combining with terms such as <b>any</b> or <b>at all</b> , which normally occur only where a negative is present (thus, standard usage is I've got <b>hardly any</b> money, but not I've got <b>any</b> money).

Consider a construction such as Sheila had hardly recovered from the flu when she lost her beloved beagle: in speech, one might tend to use <b>than</b> as the complement to <b>hardly</b> , but in careful writing, since time is the point, the word to use is <b>when</b> . In a more formal context, however, the idea would be better conveyed: No sooner had Sheila recovered from the flu than she lost her beloved beagle. In this sentence, than does belong because it is the natural conjunction after the comparative adjective sooner. <b>3</b> As synonyms, hardly, barely, and scarcely are almost indistinguishable."}],"hardman":[{"word":"hardman","description":{"noun":[{"description":"<div><i>‹informal›</i> a tough, aggressive, or ruthless man.</div>"}]},"pronunciation":"/ˈhärdman/"}],"hardness":[{"word":"hardness","description":{"noun":[{"description":"<div>the quality or condition of being hard<div>• <i>people complained about the hardness of the chairs</i></div><div>• <i>a lack of mental hardness.</i></div></div>"}]},"pronunciation":"/ˈhärdnəs/"}],"hard-nosed":[{"word":"hard-nosed","description":{"adjective":[{"description":"<div><i>‹informal›</i> realistic and determined; tough-minded<div>• <i>the hard-nosed, tough approach.</i></div></div>"}]},"pronunciation":"/ˈhärd ˈˌnōzd/"}],"hard nut":[{"word":"hard nut","description":{"noun":[{"description":"<div><i>(Brit.)</i> <i>‹informal›</i> a tough, aggressive, or insensitive person.</div>"}]}}],"hard-on":[{"word":"hard-on","description":{"noun":[{"description":"<div><i>‹vulgar slang›</i> an erection of the penis.</div>"}]},"pronunciation":"/ˈhär ˌdän/"}],"hard palate":[{"word":"hard palate","description":{"noun":[{"description":"<div>the bony front part of the palate.</div>"}]},"pronunciation":"/härd ˈpalət/"}],"hardpan":[{"word":"hardpan","description":{"noun":[{"description":"<div>a hardened impervious layer, typically of clay, occurring in or below the soil and impairing drainage and plant growth.</div>"}]},"pronunciation":"/ˈhärdˌpan/"}],"hard-paste":[{"word":"hard-paste","description":{"adjective":[{"description":"<div>denoting true porcelain made of fusible and infusible materials (usually kaolin and china stone) fired at a high temperature.

A traditional view is that <b>have got</b> is chiefly British, but not correct in formal writing, while <b>have</b> is chiefly American. Actual usage is more complicated: <b>have got</b> is in fact also widely used in US English. In both US and British usage, <b>have</b> is more formal than <b>have got</b> , and it is more appropriate in writing to use constructions such as <b>don't have</b> (or <b>do not have</b> ) rather than <b>haven't got</b> . See also usage at <a>gotten</a> . <b>2</b> A common mistake is to write the word <b>of</b> instead of <b>have</b> or <b>'ve</b> : I <b>could of</b> told you that instead of I <b>could've</b> told you that. The reason for the mistake is that the pronunciation of <b>have</b> in unstressed contexts is the same as that of <b>of</b> , and the two words are confused when it comes to writing them down. The error was recorded as early as 1837 and, although common, is unacceptable in standard English. <b>3</b> Another controversial issue is the insertion of <b>have</b> where it is superfluous, as, for example, I might have missed it if you <b>hadn't have</b> pointed it out (rather than the standard … if you <b>hadn't</b> pointed it out). This construction has been around since at least the 15th century, but only where a hypothetical situation is presented (e.g., statements starting with <b>if</b> ). More recently, there has been speculation among grammarians and linguists that this insertion of <b>have</b> may represent a kind of subjunctive and is actually making a useful distinction in the language. However, it is still regarded as an error in standard English."}],"Havel, Václav":[{"word":"Havel, Václav","description":{"definition":[{"description":"(1936–2011), Czech playwright and statesman; president of Czechoslovakia 1989–92 and of the Czech Republic 1993–2003.
