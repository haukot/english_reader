There is a historical explanation for this: in Old English, the principal sense of <b>man</b> was ‘a human being,’ and the words <b>wer</b> and <b>wif</b> were used to refer specifically to ‘a male person’ and ‘a female person,’ respectively. Subsequently, <b>man</b> replaced <b>wer</b> as the normal term for ‘a male person,’ but at the same time the older sense ‘a human being’ remained in use. In the second half of the 20th century, the generic use of <b>man</b> to refer to ‘human beings in general’ (as in reptiles were here long before man appeared on the earth) became problematic; the use is now often regarded as sexist or old-fashioned. In some contexts, terms such as <b>the human race</b> or <b>humankind</b> may be used instead of <b>man</b> or <b>mankind</b> . Certain fixed phrases and sayings, such as time and tide wait for no <b>man</b> can be easily rephrased (e.g., time and tide wait for no <b>one</b> ). Alternatives for other related terms exist as well: the noun <b>manpower</b> , for example, can usually be replaced with <b>staff</b> or <b>crew</b> , and in most cases, the verbal form <b>to man</b> can be expressed as <b>to staff</b> or <b>to operate</b> ."}],"Man.":[{"word":"Man.","description":{"abbreviation":[{"description":"<div>Manitoba.</div>"}]}}],"-man":[{"word":"-man","description":{"combining form":[{"description":"<div>1. in nouns denoting.</div><div>2. a male of a specified nationality or origin<div>• <i>Frenchman</i></div><div>• <i>Yorkshireman.</i></div></div><div>3. a man belonging to a distinct specified group<div>• <i>layman.</i></div></div><div>4. a person, especially a male, having a specified occupation or role<div>• <i>exciseman</i></div><div>• <i>chairman</i></div><div>• <i>oarsman.</i></div></div><div>5. a ship of a specified kind<div>• <i>merchantman.</i></div></div>"}]},"origin":"<b>usage:</b> Traditionally, the form <b>-man</b> was combined with other words to create a term denoting an occupation or role, as in <b>fireman</b> , <b>layman</b> , <b>chairman</b> , and <b>mailman</b> .
